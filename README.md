# A-star-vanilla-js
A small implementation of A* algorithm written in js/html/css

This project has no goal but programming fun and discovering A* algorithm

You can't run this project by opening index.html because it uses js modules (and CORS policy don't like that :'() but you can serve it on a simple http server like npm's [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
